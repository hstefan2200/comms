add_noise():
    this adds awgn to the input signal

    signal: this is the input signal (a numpy array)
    snr_db: signal to noise ratio in db 



    returns a signal with the added noise
    also returns the noise (isolated from the signal)

get_noise_power():
    this calculates the noise power for a given signal and snr, without acutally generating noise

    signal: input signal
    snr_db: desired snr in db

    returns calculated noise power

calculate_snr():
    this calculates the actual snr of a signal with noise (verification tool)

    signal: input signal (original)
    noise: isolated noise component

    returns snr_db (actual snr in db)
