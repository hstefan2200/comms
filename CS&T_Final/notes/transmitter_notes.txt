This was honestly pretty straightforward once I got my head around the fact that we are simply generating an audio file.

We are basically making use of the existing classes and their methods to load data (image and audio)
then we prepare that by converting to bits
then we modulate the signal (the carrier is generated within that method)
then we add awgn noise
and we're basically good to go

Added some plots to be able to analyze the signal a bits

tested audio and image "transmission" both isolated and combined. The outputted files led me to realize that the samples per symbol were far too low
    I ended up doubling it, which is fine for now
        (the combined transmission output was like 50min, so it is now 26)
        I'm going to wait until I can test the receiver and demodulate/reconstruction before fiddling with the input parameters too much
